# Rickroll Detector
Check a link to see if it is a rickroll, without actually clicking!
Have you even been sent a link, your friend telling you "this is really important please click", and clicking it, only to find out it is a rickroll? Times like these make you wish you could **FUCKING MURDER THAT LITTLE SHIT**. Calm down, calm down. You have two options.

A.
Fucking murder that little shit by strangulation
 
B.
Calm the **FUCK** down, and to prevent yourself from being rickrolled in the future, download this, and if any link sounds suspicious, just input it into this program and it will check for you.

You have 3 ways of running this:
Downloading and running the Python script (note that this was made in Python 3)
Running the EXE file on a Windows platform
Running the .sh file on a Linux platform (make sure to `chmod +x` it before running)

If you found another rickroll that wasn't detected, don't get mad, open an issue stating this, and give us the link.
If you do open an issue, please note that the rickroll link has to be from YouTube, and not from any other platform. This means that the link can only have the youtube.com or youtu.be domain. If you submit a link that isn't a rickroll, is a rickroll but not from YouTube, or a shortened link that doesn't lead to a rickroll, your issue will be closed.

Enjoy!
